Dimensions and Measures
  The easiest way to distinguish is that:
    Dimensions (Blue) are INDEPENDENT variables
    Measures (Green) are DEPENDENT variables

If want our own custom fields
  1. Right Click at "Measures" section
  2. Click on "Create Calculated Field..."
  3. Provide a name and formula for values

To add colors, drag field to Color Button.
  You may change the color palette by clicking Color > Edit Colors...

Data can be connected by Live or Extract
  Live is a dynamic connection, which will be updated over time
  Extract creates a static connection to work with

Aggregate
  - Form/Group Data into a class or cluster

Granularity
  - The level of detail in a dataset

Tableau will always aggregate measures at the level of granularity
  Aggregation, specified by measures
  Granularity, specified by dimensions

Hierarchy
  For example, a city can only be in one state, a state can only be in one city

Joins
  Inner Join
    Gets the intersection of field(s)

  Left Outer Join
    Sets Table A as the primary table, which keeps all of Table A's rows in the final
    table. Table B's rows will be shown only if there is an intersection on field(s)

  Right Outer Join
    Similar to above, but B is the primary table.

  Full Outer Join
    Shows all the rows in both tables. The rows are merged if there is an intersection
    on field(s)

Blend
  - Is a smart and flexible join on the fly
  - Is a left join

Joins vs Blends
  Use joins when combining data at row level

  Use blends when datasources have different levels of granularity
  Use blends when datasources come from different systems

Combine charts using Dual Axis Charts
  Remember to synchronize the axes!

Create Custom territories via:-
  Groups
  Geographic Roles

Use Highlighters to "filter" without interrupting data

Tableau Analytics
  Clusters to create clusters using K-means clustering
  Trends to create regression lines using Regression Modeling
