# Data Science

One of my interests in the field is Artificial Intelligence, which involves amazing topics such as machine learning. 

While I have had some experience with classification, clustering and machine learning algorithms, I would like to further my knowledge in this area.

This repository will keep all my data science projects. For now, I will be working with Python, but I would definitely try to experiment with R in the future.
